# Intro

<p>Hello,</p> 

<p>My name is <b>Achraf Trabelsi</b>, <br>I created my personal website 👨🏻‍💻 where you can consult my CV and my various articles that talk about Apple technologies: iOS 📱, macOS  🖥, watchOS ⌚️, Swift, etc ...</p>

<p>I started iOS development in 2015 during my graduation internship 🎓. This is the first time I have touched a macbook in my life. I started to learn the Objective-C language, it was too complicated with its weird syntax. Then I switched to the Swift language, I was amazed 🤩 by this language: safe, flexible, fast 🚀. And since then I became passionate about mobile development and especially development for Apple platforms.</p>

<p>I created this website to help me write and share what I learn every day.</p>
